        My name is Nwakamma Roy Chikadibia. I am a native of Obowo.L.G.A.Imo State 
        Nigeria. I am currently a first year medical student in the university
        Of calabar, Cross River State. I am a self trained athlete who loves sports 
        and fitness. I have not always been keen about the tech field, but during
        the ASUU strike, i decided to give it a try. And i must say it has helped
        me discover many things about myself. coding helps us to think, it helps
        us in decision making and problem solving. This will be a very great asset 
        to me in the medical field. I am determined to keep learning so that i 
        will become a pro and in turn apply my skills in helping humanity.
        Technology is greatly applied in the medical field. Africa needs help
        in this area. My motto is to always aim at the best. DETERMINATION
        DEICATION AND DISCIPLINE.
